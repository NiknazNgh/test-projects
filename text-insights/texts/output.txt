Let's break it down step by step:

1st row (earbuds):
Each icon shows a pair of earbuds.
+0 +0 =30

Equatio1
So, 3 pairs = 30 — each pair = 10.

2nd row (person + person + earbuds pair = 20):
2+2+10=20- & + & =10-eachperson=5.

3rd row (watches + person = 13):

(a pair of watches in one icon) + +2=13
So, (2xwatches) + (2xwatches) + 5 = 13

That's 4xwatches + 5 = 13 — 4xwatches = 8 — each watch = 2.

4th row (trick row):

It shows: ()) (but now just one earbud, not a pair!) + 2 x
© One earbud (not a pair) = 10> 2=5
© Person =5
© One watch = 2

Now calculate carefully:
54+ (5x 2)=54+10=15

Final Answer: 15
